Hi!,

I'm Isma.
I have been _doing stuff with code and people_ since 1998[^*].

I started my career developing apps for D<sup>3</sup> DBMS, and that was the starting point of a fun story that has seen me acting as a backend developer, sysadmin and frontend developer.

I consider myself a software developer, but I have found myself leading projects and teams in quite complex environments, and I found joy in doing that too.

In the last 5 years I have been moving more and more towards front-end projects and I am currently leading the front end development team in [QMetric](http://www.qmetric.co.uk).
[^*]: although my first Logo programming course happened back in 1986...
